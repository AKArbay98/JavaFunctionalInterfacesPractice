This project demonstrates the use of functional interfaces provided by the java.util.function package in Java. Functional interfaces are crucial for writing concise and readable code using lambda expressions and method references, introduced in Java 8.

Features:
Comprehensive examples of key functional interfaces, including:
Consumer, Supplier, Function, Predicate
BinaryOperator, UnaryOperator
ObjIntConsumer, ObjDoubleConsumer, ObjLongConsumer
DoubleFunction, DoubleBinaryOperator
Hands-on demonstrations of how these functional interfaces provide target types for lambda expressions and method references.
Simple, real-world use cases to help understand the behavior and utility of each interface.
Purpose:
This repository is designed to help Java developers understand the power of functional programming in Java, specifically through the use of the java.util.function package. It serves as a quick reference and educational resource for anyone looking to learn or refresh their knowledge of functional interfaces in Java.

Topics Covered:
Basics of lambda expressions and method references
Writing concise and efficient code with functional interfaces
Exploring various built-in functional interfaces from the java.util.function package
Examples of practical use cases such as data transformations, filtering, and operations on primitive types
